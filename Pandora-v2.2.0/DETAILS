DETAILS

  The Pandora computer program is a general-purpose non-LTE atmospheric
  modeling and spectrum synthesis code which has been used extensively to
  determine models of the solar atmosphere, other stellar atmospheres, and
  nebulae. The Pandora program takes into account, for a model atmosphere
  which is either planar or spherical, which is either stationary or in
  motion, and which may have an external source of illumination, the
  time-independent optically-thick non-LTE transfer of line and continuum
  radiation for multilevel atoms and multi\ ple stages of ionization, with
  partial frequency redistribution, fluorescence, and other physical processes
  and constraints, including momentum balance and radiat\ ive energy balance
  with mechanical heating. Pandora includes the detailed effects of both
  particle diffusion and flow velocities in the equations of ionization
  equilibrium. Such effects must be taken into account whenever the
  temperature gradient is large, such as in a chromosphere-corona transition
  region.

  This program was written by Rudy Loeser (RL) under the supervision of Eugene
  Avrett (EA). This release holds version 78.018, as left by Rudy, but for
  minor fixes to avoid compilation and runtime errors (SGK).

  It has been tested using two compilers: ifort and pgif77, both using the
  compilation flag -O.

  It was packaged by Sylvain Korzennik (SGK), who rewrote the wrapper scripts,
  and made sure that pandoar compiles under the PGI and Intel F77
  compilers. SGK also consolidated the documenation in two documents: wup and
  paper.

  The actual executables are:

    bin/pandora   - C-shell script to run the pandora executable (SGK)
    bin/pandora.x - the pandora f77 executable (RL)
    bin/pmerge    - PERL script to merge parameters
    bin/ready     - C-shell script to run the ready executable (SGK)
    bin/ready.x   - f77 executable (RL) used to prepare input files
    bin/extract   - C-shell script to extract output of pandora in a machine
                    readable format (SGK) 
    bin/census    - C-shell script to correct the fractional ionization for a
                    given ion (SGK) 
                    runs the f77 executables cents.x census.x dimes.x
    bin/cents.x   - f77 executable to build the input file for census.x,
                    updating a given atom. (RL) 
    bin/census.x  - f77 executable to determine abundance ratios (RL)
    bin/dimes.x   - f77 executable to separate an abundance ratios file
                    produced by census.x into one per ion. (RL) 

  The following (util/) do not have an updated C-shell scripts (yet) 

    bin/he1diff.x - f77 executable (RL) extracts PALBET/PBETAL from a
                    ---he1.msc file 
    bin/modup.x   - f77 executable (RL) updates a model file from a given
                    ---.pop file. 
    bin/wrap.x    - f77 executable (RL) sets aside a PANDORA input file
                    (---.dat) by modifying the header, and the IOMX statement

    RL's codes are FORTRAN77 and use LUs (logical units) to read and
  write. The codes do not use any filename. The c-shell wrappers allow you to
  avoid having to use names like fort.1 and fort.29. These wrappers have been
  written to use a specific file name structure based on an atmosperic model
  name, an atom, a number of levels and a run identifier. The pandora wrapper
  looks first if all the required file exists, check that no output files for
  that specific case exists, and upon completion removes the temporary file
  used by the code.

    Pmerge is a PERL script to copy tables between files, i.e., to copy some
  tables from an output file (like a population profile) to an input file,
  rather than using an editor.

    Extract is a C-shell script that uses the UNIX command sed to extract what
  RL calls a section from the main output file of pandora (.aaa file), using
  the index file (.aix file). That section is also converted to be 'machine
  readable'. Namely, each output line either is tagged as a comment (starts
  with a ;) or is a table of numbers, whose first column is an index. The
  resulting file can, in principle, be read with the IDL routine read_out.pro
  (see below)

  Additional IDL code:

    pro/init.pro      - initialization file to set IDL's path
    pro/read_out.pro  - generic file to read the output of extract
    pro/sgklib/       - library procedure used in demo .pro files
    pro/xtwiddle.pro  - IDL GUI to adjust a model T(z) profile

  These routines, written by SGK, allow you to

  (1) adjust a model temperature  profile T(z) interactively, using a GUI:

   idl pro/init
   IDL> xtwiddle, 'test.zee'


  (2) read and plot output of extract, look in demos/5 and demos/6 at the
      plot-*.pro files.

MISSING:

  Basic instructions on how to setup a run from scratch, detailed
  (overwhelming?) instructions are in RL's writeups.

  Description of the tables:

    atoms/
    opacities/
    util/ions.list
