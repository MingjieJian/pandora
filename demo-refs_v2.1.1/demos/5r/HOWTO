  ! prepare the run

  bin/ready   SPh
ready: preparing SPh
Type desired value of IOMX (I2): 11   <<< enter 11, the no of iteration
...

  ! accept the new file

  mv SPh.dat.new SPh.dat

  ! run it

  bin/pandora SP h l15 001 >& SPh.log &

  ! Demo 5 is a more elaborate case (a test model for a sunspot) and thus a
  ! longer run (~30m). 

  ! When the run has completed, you can extract section of the output with the
  ! following commands:

  bin/extract 'LINE (5/1)' SPh.aaa.001 SPh.line_5-1.out.001
  bin/extract 'PROF (5/1)' SPh.aaa.001 SPh.prof_5-1.out.001
  bin/extract 'POST (5/1)' SPh.aaa.001 SPh.post_5-1.out.001

  ! and plot this with IDL as follow

  idl pro/init
  IDL> .r plot-profile
