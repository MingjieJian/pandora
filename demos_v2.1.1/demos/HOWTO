* You must first

   - build and install the executables 
   - extracted the tables

   see the top level README

* You can run demos 1-4 as follow:

     bin/pandora -io 1/ -atoms 1/ demo1 none '' 001 >& 1/demo1.log
     bin/pandora -io 2/ -atoms 2/ demo2 h    l3 001 >& 2/demo2.log
     bin/pandora -io 3/ -atoms 3/ demo3 h    l3 001 >& 3/demo3.log
     bin/pandora -io 4/ -atoms 4/ demo4 mg2  l2 001 >& 4/demo4.log

   where

    -io    indicate where to find input and where to send the output
    -atoms indicates where to find the atomic data

    h   l3 stands for Hydrogen    - 3 levels (in file hl3.atm)
    mg2 l2 stands for MagnesiumII - 2 levels (in file mg2l2.atm)

    001 is an arbitrary string to indentify that run, all the files resulting
    from that run will have names ending w/ that string (ie *.001).

  Demos 1-4 are short runs and are explained in Rudy's documentation.

* To run demos 5, 6 & 7, look at the HOWTO in the respective directories (5/ 6/ & 7/)

* You can check

   what the demos should produce using the tar-compressed archive
   pandora-vX.X.X-demos-refs.tgz

   tar xv /where/downloaded/pandoora-vX.X.X-demos-refs.tgz

   and look at the directories 1r, 2r, ..., 7r
 
Good luck.
